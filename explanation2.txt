-----------------------------------------------------
"Laravel 10 CRUD(CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE) Tutorial - AJAX
with full validations.."

part 2 covers:
--------------
- UPDATE/EDIT 
- DELETE

so let's get started..

before we begin with our today's task..

I did some corrections in the last video..

- automatic modal closeup..
- page reload after successfully added new car..

after finishing all the changes i have done the page should work as follows..

so, that's it..

now, let's continue with delete part..

then, let's create a delete mechanism
..

now, try to delete a car..

for edit, car functionality.. 

start by creating a modal for editing car details..

on pop of a modal you should display the car details filled in a form.

now try to edit car details..

so now you can add, read, update and delete any car..

so, that's it..
